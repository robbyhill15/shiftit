# Getting Started #
The Shift It application will let you control Mac OS X windows easily. Say "Good Bye" to dragging the screens to move. With Shift It, you can easily move your windows and resize them with a few handy hotkeys.

**You need to have ["Enable access for assistive devices"](http://cocoatutorial.grapewave.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/accessibility.png) enabled in Universal Access preference pane.**

# Benefits #

Here are some of the benefits of using Shift It:
  * No more hassle of dragging windows to move them
  * Make you of the predefined areas to move the window.
    * For example, you can move a window to cover the left of your screen by using alt+Cmd+left arrow. See [HotKeys](HotKeys.md) for all the hotkeys.
    * Also, you can make the focused window fill the whole screen. See screenshots below to see how it works.
