### Important changes ###
As of check-in version #22, Shift It cannot be built alone. You will have to configure Shift It to include the Sparkle.Framework.

**To make ShiftIt build, you would have just follow these two steps:
  1. Download the [Sparkle Framework](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/)
  1. Copy the Sparkle.Framework file and paste in the ShiftIt Folder**

#### Check for Updates and Automatically Update functions ####
Since "Check for Updates" and "Automatically Update" functions are dependent on the Sparkle Framework, these functions will not work if you do not modify the ShiftIt-Info.plist file. For detailed changes, please refer to [Sparkle Framework Documentation](http://wiki.github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle/)
